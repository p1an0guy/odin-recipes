      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. 
        Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. 
        This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.</p>
